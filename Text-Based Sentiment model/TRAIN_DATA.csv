[NAME]. I‚Äôll keep my teeth thanks. They‚Äôre better (and more useful) companions than a weird dude.,0,97

That's my favorite! It smells so good without being overpowering.,3,65
Yeah that's funny. Girl who didn't like that is probably some [NAME] wannabe thot.,3,82
I realised that baby [NAME] looked like young [NAME] and it really upset me. So you all have to deal with that now too.,5,119
I am curious how much he will get,5,33

Oh ok! Thanks for the info.And oh [NAME] I can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like,3,82
The guy who thought of this chokes the chicken.,6,47
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.,1,156
"""They say you have to spend money to make money. I don't know where we went wrong, we spent *all* our money"" ",6,109
Haha I hope this is real. Look up neti pot. Warm water will soften the paper and come out.,3,90

I know they had an extremely toxic relationship but [NAME] was so much more tolerable when he was with [NAME].,6,110
I don‚Äôt think it retains more fat but you can get bloated and stuff and retaining water will make the scale go up,6,113
Just because you stopped to let me cross doesn't mean the other 3 lanes of cars did.,0,84
no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.,0,111
Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck,0,83
